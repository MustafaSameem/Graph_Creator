# Projects
This repositary includes a interactive graph maker in C++. It is divided in multiple classes and functions such as adding, removing and searching are included and can be called at any moment. 

An algorithm is also implemented to display all paths given a starting and ending vertex. The graph can be reset without having to terminate the program.
