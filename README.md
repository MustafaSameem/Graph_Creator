# Graph Implementation in C++

This C++ project implements a simple graph data structure with support for directed and undirected graphs. The project includes classes for vertices, edges, and two types of graphs: directed and undirected.

## Project Structure

- **vertex.h:** Header file for the `Vertex` class, representing a graph vertex.
- **vertex.cpp:** Implementation file for the `Vertex` class.
- **edge.h:** Header file for the `Edge` class, representing a graph edge.
- **edge.cpp:** Implementation file for the `Edge` class.
- **abstract.h:** Header file for the abstract `Graph` class, serving as a base class for directed and undirected graphs.
- **directed.h:** Header file for the `DirectedGraph` class, implementing a directed graph.
- **directed.cpp:** Implementation file for the `DirectedGraph` class.
- **undirected.h:** Header file for the `UndirectedGraph` class, implementing an undirected graph.
- **undirected.cpp:** Implementation file for the `UndirectedGraph` class.
- **main.cpp:** Interactive main program allowing users to create, modify, and explore graphs.

## How to Run

1. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Choose the type of graph (directed or undirected).
4. Follow the interactive menu to perform various operations on the graph, such as adding vertices, adding edges, removing vertices, removing edges, searching for vertices and edges, displaying the graph, and finding paths between vertices.
